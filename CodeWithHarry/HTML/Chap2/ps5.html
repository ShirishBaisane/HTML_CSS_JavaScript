    <h1>Computer programming</h1>
    <hr>
    <small>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</small>
    <br><p><strong>Computer programming</strong> is the process of performing a particular <a href="computing.html">computation</a> (or more generally, accomplishing a specific computing result), usually by designing and building an executable <a href="computing.html">computer program</a>. Programming involves tasks such as analysis, generating algorithms, profiling algorithms' accuracy and resource consumption, and the implementation of algorithms (usually in a chosen <a href="computing.html">programming language</a>, commonly referred to as coding).<sup>[1][2]</sup> The source code of a program is written in one or more languages that are intelligible to programmers, rather than machine code, which is directly executed by the central processing unit. The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will automate the performance of a task (which can be as complex as an operating system) on a <a href="computing.html">computer</a>, often for solving a given problem. Proficient programming thus usually requires expertise in several different subjects, including knowledge of the application domain, specialized algorithms, and formal logic.</p>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <hr>
    <p><a href="computing.html">Programmable devices</a> have existed for centuries. As early as the 9th century, a programmable music sequencer was invented by the Persian Banu Musa brothers, who described an automated mechanical flute player in the <a href="computing.html"><em>Book of Ingenious Devices</em></a>.<sup>[4][5]</sup> In 1206, the Arab engineer Al-Jazari invented a programmable drum machine where a musical mechanical automaton could be made to play different rhythms and drum patterns, via pegs and <a href="computing.html">cams</a>.<a href="computing.html"><sup>[6][7]</sup></a> In 1801, the Jacquard loom could produce entirely different weaves by changing the "program" - a series of pasteboard cards with holes punched in them.</p>
    <p>In the 1880s Herman Hollerith invented the concept of storing data in machine-readable form. Later a control panel (plug board) added to his 1906 Type I Tabulator allowed it to be programmed for different jobs, and by the late 1940s, unit record equipment such as the IBM 602 and IBM 604, were programmed by control panels in a similar way, as were the first electronic computers. However, with the concept of the stored-program computer introduced in 1949, both programs and data were stored and manipulated in the same way in computer memory.</p>
    <h3>Machine language</h3>
    <p>Machine code was the language of early programs, written in the instruction set of the particular machine, often in binary notation. Assembly languages were soon developed that let the programmer specify instruction in a text format (e.g., ADD X, TOTAL), with abbreviations for each operation code and meaningful names for specifying addresses. However, because an assembly language is little more than a different notation for a machine language, two machines with different instruction sets also have different assembly languages.</p>
    <h3>Compiler languages</h3>
    <p>High-level languages made the process of developing a program simpler and more understandable, and less bound to the underlying hardware. The first compiler related tool, the A-0 System, was developed in 1952[12] by Grace Hopper, who also coined the term 'compiler'.[13][14] FORTRAN, the first widely used high-level language to have a functional implementation, came out in 1957,[15] and many other languages were soon developedâ€”in particular, COBOL aimed at commercial data processing, and Lisp for computer research.</p>
